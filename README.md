User Stories:

```
As the user, I expect, that upon entering the Url, I see a view with a sign up, sign in and a title of what I am signing into such as the title, “Tic Tac Toe Game”

As the User, I expect to be able to sign up with my email and password and sign in with my email and password.

As the User, I expect that when I sign in, I am given access to the Tic Tac Toe Game, and that I can see the layout of the game.

As the User, I expect the game to be multi-player so that I have someone to play the game with.

As the User, I expect that once I click on one of the spaces in the Tic Tac Toe grid, that an X appears in that space.

As the User, I expect it to be the other players turn and for the game to indicate this.

As the User, I expect that the other player will not be able to take the space that I have just previously occupied. I expect there to be an error if the other player tries to take my spot.

As the User, I expect that once the other player clicks on an empty slot that an O appears in that slot.

As the User, I expect that I will not be able to take the other player’s slot.

As the User I expect for it to now be my turn.

As the User, I expect two conditions: either myself, or the other player, has won, or we have tied.

If either of us have won, I expect the game to be able to acknowledge that there are three symbols in a row and to tell us who has won.

If we tie, then I expect that no one has won, and that the game tells us that we tied.

As the User, I expect that the only way we can tie is if all the board is filled with X and Os. Therefore, as the User I expect that the game can record this and once it determines that all the 9 slots are occupied, with the entirety of the board not having any of the two symbols align with two others of its own kind, then it stops the game.

As the User, I expect there to be a restart button just in case we want to go for a rematch.

As the User, I expect to see a record of the games I have won and a record of games that the other player has won.

As the User, I expect to be able to sign out and to change my password

As the user, I expect that once I click Sign out the I am back to the original view and I have to sign back in to have access to the Tic Tac Toe Game.
